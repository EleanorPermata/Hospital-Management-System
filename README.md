# Hospital Management System (HMS)

This repository contains the source code and data files for a **C-based Hospital Management System (HMS)** developed as part of a group assignment for the **Introduction to C Programming (032024-NIT)** module at Asia Pacific University.

## ❗Overview

The **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is a terminal-based application designed to simulate core hospital operations. It serves various roles, **Administrator**, **Doctor**, **Patient**, and **Staff Nurse**, each with specific functionalities. This system emphasizes modular programming, file-based data storage, and secure access protocols, aligning with practices in C application development.

## ❓ How to Compile and Run
1. Download source (`Hospital_Management_System_Final.c`) and all the text (`.txt`) files in the repository.
2. Ensure all files are within the same folder.
3. Use any C compiler to compile (e.g., CodeBlocks).
4. Run the `Hospital_Management_System_Final.c` file.

## Features

**Login System**
- Role-based login for Administrator, Doctor, Patient, and Nurse.
- Three (3) login attempts limit before access lock.

**Administrator Features**
